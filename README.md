# MERN Stack Project - Followed Tutorial

This repository contains a project based on a YouTube tutorial that covers essential topics related to the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. I followed the tutorial created by [@DevEmpower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-42K44A1oMA) to build this project.

## Project Overview

In this project, I learned and implemented a range of concepts and techniques, including:

- Backend CRUD operations using Node.js and Express.js.
- Configuring CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policies for secure frontend-backend communication.
- Working with MongoDB, a NoSQL database, to perform data operations.
- Creating a frontend application with React, utilizing Vite and Tailwind CSS for development and styling.
- Implementing frontend CRUD functionality.
- Setting up client-side routing for a smoother single-page application (SPA) experience.
- Enhancing user experience (UX) with alerts and modals.
- Displaying book data as a list and individual cards.
